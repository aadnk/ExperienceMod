ExperienceMod is a plugin that makes it possible to add, or change, the types of player activity that awards experience points. This can be anything from mining blocks (also ensures no cheating with silk touch), placing blocks, crafting, brewing or even smelting. 

Configure the experience system to be more like 1.3 before it even has been released. Or you can experiment, finding a system that works better for you. It's all configurable.

FEATURES

    * Modify or remove the dropped experience by a number of factors:
     * Name of mob or creature
     * The type of damage that killed the mob/creature
     * Whether or not a mob/creature has spawned from a monster spawner
     * Whether or not the creature is tamed, or is still a baby.
    * Drop experience when players are manipulating items or blocks:
     * By the name or ID of the block
     * The durability (in some cases in text form!)
     * By potion effect, level, extended duration, and more.
    * Use permissions to decide who will be affected by the modifications. 
    * Prevent experience loss upon death.
